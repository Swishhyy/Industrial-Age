# Industrial Age
This is a mod for Fabric 1.21.1 this mod allows players to add machinery to their minecraft world (bio powered and coal powered) these machines will assist the player
eg: mining, farming, mob-farming, etc. This is to alleviate for the end game instead of having 0 tick farms or super large farms you can decide to use this mod instead.

This is my first mod in Minecraft so its a bit of a learning curve for me. If theres any issues please report them via the Issues tab and i will try to fix is ASAP.
